# musica - an amharic music streaming api
This is an online music streaming API that will mainly have a collection of licensed amharic songs.

## Why Musica?
To put it simply, there are no good amharic music streaming services in ethiopia. 

## Technology used
**Node.js** is used to build the backend API along with **MongoDB** as a database.
I tried to use clean architecture to build the backend so that it could be eaisly maintained and scale.
